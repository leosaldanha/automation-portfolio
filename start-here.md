## Welcome to my automation portfolio!

### Preface

First of all, thanks for visting my Github profile!

The goal of creating this repository was to use it as a showcase of automation frameworks that I have been studying. 

### About me

My name is Leonardo and I am passionate about test automation, developing scripts and elaborating/analyzing test architectures. I have a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering and was approved on the CTFL (Certified Tester Foundation Level) exam. My favorite programming languages are Python, Shellscript and Javascript.

### Running the test scenarios

This root of this repository has two folders:
- backend
- frontend

Inside of each one you will find a test-cases.md file, which holds all the test scenarios that were chosen to be used as a reference while automating. Although I could elaborate other different scenarios, I decided to limit these specific ones in order to make the tests more focused on trying distinct scenarios than exploring all of them as I would in a professional situation.

Together with this file, you will find one folder for each automation framework containing its own README.md file, which explains the steps to run the test scenarios.

If you have any trouble/questions, feel free to contact me through my personal e-mail (listed below).
